## Using

- tailwind
- htmx https://htmx.org/
- sinatra
- simple datatables https://github.com/fiduswriter/Simple-DataTables

### Todo
- filter just from column
- perhaps more info on each timetable (e.g connections)
- maybe price if available?
- GDPR
- Swiss option


### Try
- https://www.shalerb.org/ (object mapper for ruby could help with IE hash)

### Redesign
- map when not timetable results
- dropdown search button listing various options (or separate list)
- reverse button when timetable search results or perhaps between to and from (like kayak)
- color scheme
