# Community Night Space

Our first project is to set up a night space for socializing in Ballina. This would provide an community based, not-for-profit alternative to commercial nightclubs and late bars. The project can be considered to broadly fall within the purview of the recent government initiative to improve Irish nightlife in general. [The main NCF proposal](/proposal.html) has more details on this.

## Objectives

- Art based nightspot for post-pub socializing.
- Open-minded, tolerant, safe, welcoming environment for all.
- Dedicated venue for artists visiting North Mayo / West Sligo.

## Activities

The main purpose of the space is to facilitate socializing at night but as a member of the NCF any activity that has an arts and social element will be considered.

- Film nights
- Poetry and literature readings
- Live music
- Djs
- Practice
- Dance
- Workshops
- Installations
- Classes

Sign up, come to a meeting and propose your activity.
