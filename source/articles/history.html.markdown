*Did you know Mayo has its own Metro?  Well it does (kind of)! Don't worry most people aren't aware it exists either,  read on for a brief history of "the Maytró".*

### History

The Maytró started out life as "Mayolink" and was an idea developed by Frank Dawson, a civil servant in the Galway city council and native of Claremorris.

I met Frank as part of an eclectic group of students, railway enthusiasts, environmentalists, business people, rail-freight professionals, local politicians and activists who came together in 2002 to fight the latest attempt by Iarnród Éireann to close regional railways, including the Ballina line.

It was the height of Celtic tiger madness and IÉ, anxious to get in on the property development game, decided to wind up their profitable rail freight services to free up land for development.  Lines that were open primarily for freight (like Ballina) were for the chop [^1].

Thankfully IÉ were thwarted (they had another more successful crack after the [GFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007%E2%80%932008_financial_crisis)) and as a group we even managed to usher in Ireland's first private rail services since nationalization, carrying freight traffic from Ballina to Dublin and Waterford. Ballina was saved, hurray!

Frank Dawson wasn't happy with that and saw an opportunity to improve on the status quo further.  At the time the Ballina branch train was still pulled by a locomotive which meant that at the end of each trip the engine needed to be turned around.  As there were no facilities to do this at the junction of the Dublin and Ballina lines it instead ran up and down to the next station (Claremorris) empty for each train, fully staffed.  A "ghost train" as Frank termed it in his proposal.  At this time IÉ had a couple of unused railcars and Frank's argument was, why not take one of these railcars and run it up and down between Westport and Ballina, instead of the empty trains? The staff were there, the rolling stock was there, the infrastructure was there, all sunk costs. Why not just provide a service?

At this time Westontrack was kicking off its own campaign and Frank was busy with that so he passed the Mayolink torch to myself somewhat. To be honest I can't remember how it all happened exactly or even when but with the help of a couple of mavericks - Billy Lewis in the Ballina IRD and Jerry Cowley, the independent TD for Mayo at the time - a 'delegation' was put together to meet the Minister of Transport, Séamus Brennan, to put the case for Mayolink to him.  I use the word maverick because the idea seemed daft in the context of the times when we were building out our motorway network and were fully invested in car transport.

I was doing my accounting exams at the time so it was left to me to put together some figures that made the economic case for the service, not too hard to be fair. I included some references to the recently published National Spatial Strategy [^2] which aspired to link the fortune's of Ballina and Castlebar towns and that was it, more or less.

We met Brennan in the department buildings in 2003 sometime and gave our presentations. The only record I can find of this event is a reference in a speech by Jerry Cowley which I think I wrote for him, at least in part [^3].  Anyway Brennan whisked in and out, thanking us for whatever it was we had just said and showed us to the refreshments. And that was that, or so I thought.

Unbeknownst to me the Maytró was born in 2007 with the arrival of a railcar in Ballina and the new timetable [^4].  If you read Jerry Cowley's speech you can get an outline of what kind of service that had been advocated. Something with local branding, community run, direct from Ballina to Westport, marketed etc. What IÉ delivered was the worst possible version. Zero marketing, basically no acknowledgement that the service even existed, only connecting trains (and very poor connections at that) and a ridiculous price, 15.90 euro If memory serves one way, basically the same price as to Dublin.

A friend of mine ended up serving on the board of IÉ and I asked him to look into the pricing algorithm used for the line. He rejoined that there was no algorithm, that everything was done by hand still and that although the pricing boffins had never heard of the Ballina Westport service, they would look into it.  I don't know if it was my friend's heroic intervention (thanks James!) or pure coincidence  but the price was adjusted to a more reasonable amount, today around 7.50 euro, and I can happily report from personal experience, having recently returned to Ireland myself, that Maytró does indeed exist and is being used, in so far as it can be.

In fact if you are lucky enough to live in either of the Metropoli of Foxford or Ballina, you are currently enjoying a service of 8 trains each way, with the first one leaving Ballina at 5:05 and the last one arriving back in Ballina 21:32.  The interval between each train in either direction is about 2 hours on average.  This makes it a more frequent service than any available in Derry, Limerick, Galway or Waterford, numbers 4-7 of Ireland's most populous cities.

An Maightró abú!
